# Simple redirects for common patterns
# Note: Astro builds with directory format, so /docs/introduction/ serves /docs/introduction/index.html
# We don't need explicit trailing slash redirects as they can cause loops

# Legacy URL redirects (if you had different URL patterns before)
# /old-docs/* /docs/:splat 301

# Fallback for SPA-like behavior (commented out for static sites)
# /* /index.html 200
